The goal of `lambdar` is to provide a plug-and-play solution to running R on AWS lambda. The initial
inspiration was provided by [mdneuzerling/r-on-lambda](https://github.com/mdneuzerling/r-on-lambda).
Also see the 
[acompanying blog post](https://mdneuzerling.com/post/r-on-aws-lambda-with-containers/).
