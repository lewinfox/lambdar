In this article we will walk through the process of creating and deploying an R function in AWS
Lambda using the `lambdar` package.

AWS Lambda does not currently provide a pre-packaged runtime for R. However, it does allow you to
create lambda functions that use a custom Docker image. The goal of `lambdar` is to make creating
these Docker images as easy as possible so you can focus on the code rather than the infrastructure.


## Setup

You will need:

* An AWS account
* Docker
* R

I also assume you're using RStudio, although it's not strictly necessary.


## Create your function

In RStudio, create a new project. I'm calling mine `lambdar-test`.

Once you have the project open, create a file `main.R` and add a function called `hello_world()`.
Using roxygen-style comments, tag the function with `@lambda`. This tells lambdar's build system
that you want to deploy this function.

``` r
# main.R

#' @lambda
hello_world <- function(name = NULL) {
  if (is.null(name)) {
    name <- "World"
  }
  paste0("Hello, ", name, "!")
}
```

At the moment your project will look pretty boring.

```
.
├── lambdar-test.Rproj
└── main.R
```

## Initialise lambdar

Call `lambdar::use_lambdar()`. This does a number of things:

First, it creates a `.lambdar/` directory in your project. Next, it writes a file in that directory
called `lambdar_runtime.R`. The runtime is a script that passes incoming requests from AWS to your 
code, and returns the results of your code to AWS so they can be passed on to your users. Changing
this file could cause things to break, so leave it alone unless you know what you're doing.

Next, `lambdar` scans all the `.R` files in your project looking for functions with the `@lambda`
tag. This is so it knows which files need to be included in your container. It will also try and 
detect any R packages your function needs by looking for `library()` and `package::function()` calls
in your code.

Once this is done, `lambdar` writes a `_lambdar.yml` configuration file to your project directory,
This is the template that will be used to create a Dockerfile, which in turn will be used to create
a container image. If this doesn't make sense to you I suggest Googling "intro to Docker".

Your project now looks something like this:

```
.
├── .lambdar
│   └── lambdar_runtime.R
├── lambdar-test.Rproj
├── _lambdar.yml
└── main.R
```


## `_lambdar.yml`

`_lambdar.yml` contains all the information needed to create your container images. If you open it,
you'll see that some information has been pre-filled for you:

``` yaml
# This will be used as the container tag
app_name: "lewin/lambdar-test"

# What version of R should be installed in the container?
r_version: "4.1.0"

# List of files or directories that need to be added to the container image
include_files: [ "main.R" ]

# Specify the handler/s as `file.function_name`. Omit `.R` from the file name.
lambda_handlers: [ "main.hello_world" ]

# List any extra R packages you need to have installed in the container
r_packages: [  ]

# List any extra Linux packages you need to have installed in the container
linux_packages: [  ]

# Specify any environment variables your function needs.
#
# NOTE: Do not use YAML lists here. Copy the syntax in the example variables below.
# TODO: Support `env` being a list as well as this syntax
env:
  LAMBDAR_APP_NAME: "lewin/lambdar-test"
  LAMBDAR_VERSION: "0.1.0"

```

### Parameters

* `app_name`: What do you want your container to be called? This is arbitrary - the default name is
  `<your_username>/<name_of_project_folder>`. This parameter doesn't affect the contents of the 
  container at all, but it will be used as the Docker tag (see docker build -t).
* `r_version`: What version of R do you want installed in the container? The default is whatever
  version of R you're currently running. If you want to specify a different version, enter it as
  `"major.minor.patch"`, e.g. `"3.6.3"`.
* `include_files`: This is a list of files that need to be copied into the container. `lambdar` has
  populated this as best it can by looking for files that contain functions tagged with `@lambdar`,
  but if your code needs any other files (for example, if you're `source()`-ing any other files or
  if you need to include data files), list them here. At the moment `lambdar` does not support 
  files nested within folders - although the files will be copied over, the directory structure will
  be lost and everything will end up in the same directory in the container. Although it's messy,
  keep all your code and data files in your project's root directory.
* `lambda_handlers`: Each lambda instance calls a single function. We need to tell AWS where to find
  that function, which we do by feeding it a handler string in the format `"file.function_name"`.
  Note that there is no `.R` in the filename and no `()` at the end of the function name. Make sure
  that your handler functions don't contain any characters other than letters, numbers and
  underscores.
* `r_packages`: A list of any additional R packages that your function requires. `lambdar` will have
  filled this in as best it can, but if you need anything else, enter the names here.
* `linux_packages`: If your function needs any additional Linux libraries, mention them here.
  `lambdar` does not give you any help here! If you omit a required package here you will encounter
  errors when building the Dockerfile in the next step.
* `env`: A list of environment variables to be set in the container. `_lambdar.yml` contains two,
  `LAMBDAR_APP_NAME` and `LAMBDAR_VERSION` - these are not used by anything at the moment and are
  just there to demonstrate the syntax.
